During one of the most testing times in the history of mankind, when the whole world is tormented by the Coronavirus, the vaccine becomes one of the most prayed for word. 
As the new coronavirus continues to spread to the people around the world, the vaccine is seen as the best way to stop it.
The proposed work in this paper is an Online Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution System that uses web-based platform to enable people to get themselves registered for 
vaccination which makes the task of making registration easy and reliable for the users. 
This project focus on developing a web page to record the details of the people who needs to be vaccinated and allotting the slot to the users who have registered 
appear for vaccination on the nearby hospital on allotted day.	
This webpage has been developed for real-time monitoring of coronavirus vaccine delivery, recording data and to enable people to get themselves registered for vaccination. 
This method will fasten and smoothen the process of distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. 
There will be a fair distribution of vaccine to the people and hospital can keep track of vaccines.

In this system the user can register for vaccine, there is no login for user. These registered users accounts will be monitored and regulated by using administrative 
access to the database. Authenticated login/entry ensures security of data and also allows different levels of access as administrator. 
Furthermore, user-friendly GUI makes using the system a child’s play while providing complete functionality. The primary objective of this web page will be to 
help agencies keep a track of Covid-19 vaccination programme and allowing Indian citizens to apply for a Covid-19 vaccine shot.
